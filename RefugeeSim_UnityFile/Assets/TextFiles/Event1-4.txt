Fields of Famine
Slowly the trees started making place for farmlands. Once these field provided food for all surrounding villages. Nowadays, the sweet stench of rotting plants and dead animals lingered in the air, a thick mist covering the once lush green fields. The famine has struck this area hard. While back at home we were able to survive from the forest, the houses here have been abandoned, some torched by ravaging armies, others simply left behind by their inhabitants searching for a better life in the nearby city. Our own food supply was running low and maybe some edible things could still be found in this area, but were we really willing to go and scavenge among these fields of death? Some of the meat on the animals might not have gone bad yet, but no one was looking forward to finding out…
Scavenge for food.
Hastily make your way through the fields.
Hesitantly, I gave the order to search the area for anything edible. A few plants were found that weren’t yet rotten and free from the blight, as well as a dead cow that was reasonably fresh.
Despite our need for food, I decided it wasn’t worth to risk our health and wellbeing. At a rapid pace we moved through the fields, holding cloths in front of our faces to help deal with the terrible smell.
