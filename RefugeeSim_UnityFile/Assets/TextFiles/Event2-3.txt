Ancestral Visage
When we saw him from afar, standing still, he was gaunt and just as tall as his own gravestown. We already knew who he was. How could we not? It was on a summer's day, almost 20 years ago, when we had formed search parties to find him, lost in the woods. After a week, the parties stopped looking for him, and started searching for his body. Another week later, they found the flowers for his spread. The funeral had been a sad one. And yet he stood there. Smiling at us, looking younger than ever. He hugged us all, but his embrace was cold to the touch. “Do not worry,” he started, “The body I have has been long dead. My time here is borrowed. But let us drink, and talk of the road that lays before you.”
Let us drink.
What is borrowed can be bought. Come with us.
