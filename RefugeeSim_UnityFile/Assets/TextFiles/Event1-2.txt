Road to Forton
Unfortunately our road would lead us to the burned out town of Forton, an area the war has already ravaged. While making our way towards the village, suddenly a ragtag band of Brigands jumped out of the canopies onto the bridge. Armed with makeshift weapons like clubs with nails, improvised spears and farming equipment, they demanded us to hand over our gold. Many of them seemed young, their hands trembling as they held their weapons. I suspected sumed most of them were from Forton or the surrounding lands that met a similar faith, desperate to make ends meet. Truly the war must have hit them hard.
Give them the gold.
Fight them.
Not wanting a fight, we decided to hand over our gold. After all, what was some currency worth compared to the lives of our comrades? At least those brigands had a chance at living yet another day.
There was no way we would give up our gold, we needed it as much as they did. So I ordered some men forward, armed with knives and pitchforks. After a short clash the brigands ran, but not without killing three of our comrades. At least we still had our gold and less mouths to feed...
