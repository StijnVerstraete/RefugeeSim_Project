Sound of the Forest
Around the bridge, the forest thickened. A sudden breeze started startled the birds, who rose up in a chirping melody. While the wind rose, the whistling leaves joined in. One of the children started crying, because while the whole of the forest was being upswept, not a single hair of ours was shivering, not a single stroke of air was caressing our cheeks. The symphony swole and we cried tears because it had been ages since we were welcomed with such beauty. But our tears dripped down, undried by the breeze that brought all this in motion. But, hypnotized by the symphony, we understood. We had no place in this play. The music was nature inviting us to it’s secret realm, and we had no choice but to follow. The wind took our hands, guiding us, and we had no choice but to follow. Behold the becoming of the forest, the call of nature, our welcoming in the plane of animal, plant and root. And we had no choice but to follow. No choice but to follow. No choice but to follow.
We had no choice but to follow. To follow. To follow...
It's a trap! Stick to the path and cover your ears!
