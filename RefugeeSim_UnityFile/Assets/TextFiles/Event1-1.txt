Leaving Locgow
Word has reached us from neighbouring villages, the war reached our homeland. We all knew that it was only a matter of time until the fate of Forton would befell our beloved Locgow. We all saw the plumes of smoke rising from their part of the forest. I decided it was time to take matters into our own hands, we had to leave. As the local librarian and one of the few who could read, I was able to convince a couple of able bodied fellows to accompany me.

We could not leave those who raised us behind, even if it reduced our chances of survival. More food would have to be acquired during the journey. Maybe the few funds they brought with them could be used to purchase some, although with the famine raging I doubt anyone has food to spare...
As much as it pained us, we could not take them with us. There was already no way that we had enough food for ourselves, especially during these times of famine. Needless to say, the general mood in the group was low when we left, many weren’t happy about leaving their families behind. It was clear that difficult choices would have to be made...
